# Passive-Filter-Circuit-Analyzer

Problem Statement: Solve a simple passive filter circuit. 
 Input will be the type of filter (low pass, high pass, band pass, band stop) and 
components used (resistor, capacitor, inductor, and their values).  
 Show the schema c of the given circuit. 
 Calculate the parameters of the circuit such as cutoff frequencies, center 
frequency, bandwidth, quality factor. 
 Generate gain vs frequency and phase vs frequency curve. 
 Find the values of components for a given type of filter having specific cutoff 
frequencies, center frequency, bandwidth, quality factor. 
 Show the output and spectrum of the filter for any input given the user.  
 Build a suitable GUI.
