# Passive-Filter-Circuit-Analyzer

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Develop a tool to analyze and simulate passive filter circuits. The application should perform the following:

1. **Filter Type Input:**  
   Accept input for the type of filter (Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Band Stop) and component values (Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor).

2. **Circuit Visualization:**  
   Display the schematic diagram based on the input components and filter type.

3. **Parameter Calculation:**  
   Compute key parameters:
   - Cutoff frequency
   - Center frequency
   - Bandwidth
   - Quality factor (Q)

4. **Frequency Response Plots:**  
   Generate:
   - Gain vs Frequency plot
   - Phase vs Frequency plot

5. **Filter Design:**  
   Determine component values for a filter with user-defined specifications:
   - Cutoff frequencies
   - Center frequency
   - Bandwidth
   - Quality factor

6. **Signal Analysis:**  
   Simulate and display the output signal and spectrum for a given input waveform.

7. **Graphical User Interface:**  
   Provide a user-friendly GUI for all features above.
