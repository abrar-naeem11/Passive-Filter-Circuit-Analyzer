# Passive-Filter-Circuit-Analyzer

**Problem Statement:** Solve a simple passive filter circuit.\n
1 Input will be the type of filter (low pass, high pass, band pass, band stop) and 
components used (resistor, capacitor, inductor, and their values).  
2 Show the schematics of the given circuit. 
3 Calculate the parameters of the circuit such as cutoff frequencies, center 
frequency, bandwidth, quality factor. 
4 Generate gain vs frequency and phase vs frequency curve. 
5 Find the values of components for a given type of filter having specific cutoff 
frequencies, center frequency, bandwidth, quality factor. 
6 Show the output and spectrum of the filter for any input given the user.  
7 Build a suitable GUI.
